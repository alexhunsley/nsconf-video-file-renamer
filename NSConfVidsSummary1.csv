Talking To Hardware,Alasdair Allan,"Until recently, the restrictions placed on developers meant that if you were an independent developer, or even a small company, you probably couldnât get access to the documentation and components you needed to connect your iOS device to an arbitrary piece of hardware. Little of the innovation that people were expecting with the arrival of the External Accessories framework actually occurred, and much of the blame for this is usually laid at the feet of Apple's Made for iPod (MFi) licensing program.",133MB,45,NSConference 5 - March 2013,,,13NSConfFiveMarch2013,NSConf05

Subscription Pricing,Manton Reece,"The software market has always been one of peaks and valleys, as sales from a big release carry developers through the less busy months. The App Store only exaggerates these revenue spikes, with an emphasis on the top 10 lists, and a flood of free app gimmicks that go for volume and succeed on upsells. It can be daunting for small developers to compete.,But what if there's another way? This talk will cover the changing software market from the view of subscription pricing. We'll cover Apple's in-app purchase APIs, PayPal subscriptions, and credit card options such as the Stripe API. We'll hit the changing business requirements of recurring billing -- why subscriptions might be a better fit for apps that embrace the cloud, and how it shifts the focus away from hyping the next product launch, to just making existing customers happy.",94MB,32,NSConference 5 - March 2013,,,17NSConfFiveMarch2013,NSConf05

Baing Naive,Rob Rhyne,"I discuss the pitfalls of over-engineering and how it can affect a small business trying to ship software. Drawing experience from my consulting background, I illustrate how starting with the naive implementation can save you time for important details that will delight your audience.,The talk will center around how I designed and developed a live histogram in my shipping app, Pris. Eschewing OpenGL and other more complicated solutions, I used a little known feature in Core Animation to prototype the first version of the histogram. It worked so well, it was the final solution in the shipping app.,Part technical, part business. This talk is about little ideas making a big impact. Helping would-be app developers become shipping app developers. Inspiring them to start building to show real people instead of bragging on the internet about their clever engineering.",84MB,28,NSConference 5 - March 2013,,,19NSConfFiveMarch2013,NSConf05

Reverse Indie,Alexander Griekspoor,"Going indie is a dream, being free, being your very own one-man-band. And if things go well, you soon see your team growing, driven by a product that has so much to offer, so many cool things it could do. But as things grow you realize you'll have to make a decision: keep it a life-style business or really scaling up. This is the story of how I decided to reverse my indie-ship and join a large company again.
