nsconf-video-file-renamer
=========================

Renames the NSConf video files to have useful, well-ordered names.

The NSConf video file naming is a complete mess:

* the .m4v file names have neither the subject nor the author in them
* the number of the video in that year's session is first in the filename - useless for sorting purposes if all videos are together
* the names aren't even consistent in their crapness: sometimes you'll see "Five", sometimes you'll see "05", for example

Also see comments in the .py file.
